# Landing page

Copy and structure follow `BRAND.md`, "Marketing and metadata": the tagline is the `h1`, the
review layer is shown with persisted starter threads (the toolbar renders their pins and highlights), one solid
"Get started" and one outlined secondary action, no badges above the headline. The cover beside the
headline is the how-it-works scene (`HowItWorks`), and the description stays a direct child of the
hero's first column (tests select it as `main>section>div>p`). "Try it on this page" points visitors
to the real toolbar; it does not embed a thread.

Sections, in order, each with an `h2` whose id the navigation and footer link to (`KnownPages`):
how it works (`#how-it-works`, the small heading over the cover scene), features (`#features`), get
started (`#get-started`), pricing (`#pricing`, `LandingPricing`) and questions (`#faq`,
`LandingFaq`, native `<details>`).

- **Only what uier does today.** Every step, feature and answer describes behaviour that ships: in
  the toolbar (check `packages/toolbar`) or in the app's projects (check `src/lib`) before adding
  one. Say which parts can be tried on the page itself: the showcase is a guest, so mentions,
  assignment, environments and the MCP connector only work in a project. The showcase runs on
  every public marketing page and its inbox includes other public pages. Project embeds work on
  their configured addresses, with headers for identity and BotID proofs for writes.
- **Pictures are specimens.** The cover scene and the feature tiles are built from the tokens and
  `<Pin />` (`HowItWorks`, `LandingSpecimens`), hidden from assistive technologies, never
  screenshots; keep their text out of the strings the e2e tests look up on the page (the FAQ's
  "add one script tag to your site", the description). The starter thread "Try it here" is pinned
  to the "Try it on this page" box by `id="first-step-comment-anchor"`; the id is stored in
  production, so keep it.
- **One section moves.** The how-it-works scene is a timeline of phases (`phases` in
  `HowItWorks.tsx`); everything in it is always rendered and shown or hidden with the brand's fade,
  and the pointer's targets are measured from the scene, so it follows any width. It plays only
  while in view, Pause stops it, and with reduced motion it shows one still frame. Its canvas is
  `data-uier-decorative` with a `min-height`: the toolbar's screenshots keep its box but not its
  content (copying it made every capture on the landing page much slower). The e2e axe scan skips
  the scene (`data-landing-scene`): it is a picture, and a frame caught mid-fade has low contrast. Keep the other sections still, and keep each section's layout
  different from its neighbours.
- **Get started** (the hero and pricing) opens `/app`, like the navigation's "Sign in": signed-out
  visitors land on sign in, signed-in people in the app. The `#get-started` section below the
  features still offers both paths: trying the showcase toolbar on this page, or a project for
  your own site.
- **Pricing** is `brand.pricing`, word for word, and one free offering: no prices, tiers, trials
  or limits. The app has no billing page while everything is free.

`e2e/landing.spec.ts` asserts the title, the `h1`, the "Get started" links, the sections, the
pricing copy, the FAQ keyboard behaviour and the footer line through the brand constants; update
the test when you change those on purpose.
