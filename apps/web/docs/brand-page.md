# The brand page (`/brand`)

It is the live reference for the brand and must keep rendering from `@uier/brand` and the UI
kit (no screenshots, no copied values). When you add a brand token, component style or asset,
add it to the page in the matching section. `e2e/brand.spec.ts` checks that the page renders,
that the assets (favicon, icons, manifest, OG image) are served, and that it passes axe.
